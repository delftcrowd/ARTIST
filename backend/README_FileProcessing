## File processing readme


# General things
The file processing refers to the extraction of text from different file formats.
This is done to ensure that the users can upload files and get the text from them without difficulty.

# Where to look
application_logic/textprocessing is where python files that deal with file processing are located in.

# Contributing
Adding a new format to be extracted is very simple.
First of all, a new python class need to be created that is derived from InputType.
The following function needs to be implemented:

```
def to_text(self, input) -> str:
```

In "application_logic/textprocessing/test_text_processing", tests for the new implemented formats can be added.

# Update accepted file formats
Very important: A list containing all the accepted formats looks like this:  
```
get_supported_files()
```
Which can be found at the end of "application_logic/textprocessing/input_processor.py" .
This function needs to be updated everytime a new file format is being added.
