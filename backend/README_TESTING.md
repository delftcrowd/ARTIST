Testing is done by using python unittest

In order to run all the tests use this command in the terminal from the root of the project

```
python -m unittest discover
```

In order to run the tests only from a specific folder, run the same command while being in the folder you want to test.

IMPORTANT:
All files that contain tests need to have the format "test_*.py"
